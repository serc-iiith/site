My current primary focus is on developing a multi-agent frameworks powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable autonomous cloud operations. My interest areas include exploring the intersection of Software Engineering and AI, particularly in areas such as  Agents in SE, LLM Agents, LLMs for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), and NLP in SE.  I am passionate about building intelligent, scalable systems and am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects in the intersection of SE and ML. Beyond my professional work, I enjoy painting as a creative outlet and building automated systems for personal use, which keeps me inspired and engaged with technology in fun ways!
