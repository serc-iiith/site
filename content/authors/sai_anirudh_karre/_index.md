I am a Software Engineer with a solid skill set in developing Software Systems and Enterprise Product Design. I have strong experience developing backend layers (Data Integration/ETL/Replication/Sharding/NoSQL DB), middleware (transaction processing/messaging), and API development (REST/ODATA/SOAP/Microservices). I have built and been involved in software projects for academia and budding startup communities since 2013. I love code design patterns and refactoring legacy code. I am an avid follower of Martin Fowler's experiences in Software System development.

I am currently working as a Technical Product Manager at Accurate Background. I previously worked as a Senior Product Manager at SumTotal Systems - a Cornerstone Ondemand Company , I gained a keen interest in computing research in my early professional career. I started working as a graduate software researcher in 2014 in the area of Software Quality Engineering at the Software Engineering Research Center, IIIT Hyderabad, under the guidance of Prof. Y. Raghu Reddy. I managed to coin a software quality metric called Defect Dependency Degree. I developed a rough-set theory-based approach to calculate a dependency of a defect over the rest of the defects in a Large Scale Integrated Software Product. I published my dissertation as part of my Master of Science by Research in 2016.

In 2017, I studied different emerging technologies. I started exploring the Virtual Reality technology domain as part of my Doctoral Research program at IIIT Hyderabad. I am working on Requirement Engineering problems for Virtual Reality and hope to graduate with a Ph.D. by 2024!
