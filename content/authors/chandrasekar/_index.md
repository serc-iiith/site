I am a researcher exploring the intersection of software engineering and AI, with the focus on software architecture for machine learning (ML) systems, certifying ML systems, and developing low-code ML platforms. Previously, I worked as a full stack developer at Infosys Limited. My long-term career goal is to advance software engineering through research and innovation, Whether in academia, industry, or by starting a research-driven startup. I aim to apply my expertise to solve real-world challenges and contribute to technological advancements.

Some of my accepted works include:

1. Approach Towards Semi-Automated Certification for Low Criticality ML-Enabled Airborne Applications
2. LoCoML: A Framework for Real-World ML Inference Pipelines.
