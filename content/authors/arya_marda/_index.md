I’m currently pursuing a B. Tech. at IIIT Hyderabad, where I’m also working toward my honors degree at the Software Engineering Research Center (SERC), under the guidance of Dr. Karthik Vaidhyanathan. My research focuses on self-adaptive systems, with a particular emphasis on machine learning in edge computing and ML-based systems.I’m constantly exploring new domains, delving into areas like software engineering fundamentals, operating systems, algorithms, and low-latency development. Building tools is what I love to do, and will always continue to do.
