I am a B. Tech. Student at IIIT Hyderabad. I am also pursuing my honors degree in Software Engineering Research Center(SERC), IIIT Hyd, under the supervision of Dr. Karthik Vaidhyanathan. As part of the Research/ Honors program, I am working on self-adaptive approaches, especially toward ML-based systems. I have also been doing an Internship project on developing an observability platform for enhancing the sustainability of ML-enabled systems projects. My previous works include: Paper accepted at A* conference: ASE 2023 NIER track, it focuses on " Self-Adaptive Machine Learning-Enabled Systems Through QoS-Aware Model Switching"
