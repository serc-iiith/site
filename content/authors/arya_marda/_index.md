I’m currently pursuing a B. Tech. at IIIT Hyderabad, where I’m also working toward my honors degree at the Software Engineering Research Center (SERC), under the guidance of Dr. Karthik Vaidhyanathan. My research focuses on self-adaptive systems, with a particular emphasis on machine learning in edge computing and ML-based systems.I’m constantly exploring new domains, delving into areas like software engineering fundamentals, operating systems, algorithms, and low-latency development. Building tools is what I love to do, and will always continue to do.

I am a B. Tech. Student at IIIT Hyderabad. I am also pursuing my honors degree in Software Engineering Research Center(SERC), IIIT Hyd, under the supervision of Dr. Karthik Vaidhyanathan. As part of the Research/ Honors program, I am working on self-adaptive approaches, especially toward ML-based systems. I have also been doing an Internship project on developing an observability platform for enhancing the sustainability of ML-enabled systems projects. My previous works include: Paper accepted at A* conference: ASE 2023 NIER track, it focuses on " Self-Adaptive Machine Learning-Enabled Systems Through QoS-Aware Model Switching"
