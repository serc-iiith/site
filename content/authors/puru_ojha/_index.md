# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Puru is passionate about making virtual reality feel as natural as the real world. Fascinated by how people navigate spaces, he wanted to tackle a major challenge in VR—how to let users explore vast virtual environments while being physically confined to a small room. His research led him to develop a system for generating immersive, architecturally consistent mazes that allow for seamless, infinite exploration. By blending smart algorithms with creative design, he aims to enhance the feeling of presence in VR, making virtual spaces feel more real and intuitive to navigate

Puru has always been fascinated by the way humans interact with intelligent systems—and how those systems, in turn, interact with each other. With a background in mechanical engineering and a growing expertise in artificial intelligence and robotics, his journey has been anything but conventional. He began his career in the banking sector, where he honed his problem-solving skills in a fast-paced environment, but his passion for innovation led him back to research and development. He’s interested in making technology feel more intuitive, whether it’s a robot learning from experience or a virtual environment that responds naturally to human movement.

Over the years, he’s explored different facets of this idea. He’s worked on AI-driven applications, multilingual text analysis, and immersive virtual reality experiences. One of his recent projects involved designing dynamic, infinitely branching mazes in VR that adapt to users’ movements, creating a seamless exploration experience. But his real passion lies in robotics—specifically, how intelligent systems can transfer learned behaviors across different embodiments and interact more naturally with both humans and other machines.

At the heart of his work is a simple but powerful idea: the future of technology isn’t just about making smarter systems, but about making them work together—and with us—in more meaningful ways. He hopes to continue his research in this space, pushing the boundaries of how we build and interact with intelligent systems in the real and virtual worlds
