My research lies at the intersection of Software Architecture (SA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), exploring how AI can be applied to software architecture. Currently, I am focused on modeling and creating architectural views, using AI to generate these views from inputs such as descriptions, code, and other relevant data. Outside of my research, I enjoy reading books, cooking, and in my leisure time, I love watching movies and web series.
