Hi there! I'm Kritin, and I love computers and everything that they can do. I like architecting software, and I like machine learning, so I decided to research the intersection of the two!

Currently, I'm researching Model Driven Engineering and how we can create Low-Code or No-Code systems, to make it easier for people to achieve a specific goal without having to learn programming.

Feel free to message me if you'd like to chat more about these!
