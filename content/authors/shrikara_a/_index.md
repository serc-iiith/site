I'm a final year BTech student at IIITH, advised by Dr Karthik Vaidhyanathan of the Software Engineering Research Center. My previous work has involved sustainable MLOps using self-adaptation, architectural component generation using LLMs and simplifying CloudOps using LLMs. I work primarily in the intersection of AI and SE/SA to bridge the gap between them and improve both. I also enjoy traditional software development and architecture, particularly serverless functions and microservices and improving their quality. Besides CS, I enjoy watching and playing basketball and reading (mostlyÂ fiction).
