These include the MyIIIT app revamp, an intra-campus service platform, and the college’s sports council website. Across these, he’s aimed to make systems that are not just functional but intuitive and practical.\n\nAt SERC, he’s looking to contribute to research that connects user needs with system design, especially through field studies, iterative prototyping, and real-world validation."
