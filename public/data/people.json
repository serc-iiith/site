He began his career in the banking sector, where he honed his problem-solving skills in a fast-paced environment, but his passion for innovation led him back to research and development. He’s interested in making technology feel more intuitive, whether it’s a robot learning from experience or a virtual environment that responds naturally to human movement.\n\nOver the years, he’s explored different facets of this idea. He’s worked on AI-driven applications, multilingual text analysis, and immersive virtual reality experiences. One of his recent projects involved designing dynamic, infinitely branching mazes in VR that adapt to users’ movements, creating a seamless exploration experience. But his real passion lies in robotics—specifically, how intelligent systems can transfer learned behaviors across different embodiments and interact more naturally with both humans and other machines.\n\nAt the heart of his work is a simple but powerful idea: the future of technology isn’t just about making smarter systems, but about making them work together—and with us—in more meaningful ways. He hopes to continue his research in this space, pushing the boundaries of how we build and interact with intelligent systems in the real and virtual worlds"

I have built and been involved in software projects for academia and budding startup communities since 2013. I love code design patterns and refactoring legacy code. I am an avid follower of Martin Fowler's experiences in Software System development.\n\nI am currently working as a Technical Product Manager at Accurate Background. I previously worked as a Senior Product Manager at SumTotal Systems - a Cornerstone Ondemand Company , I gained a keen interest in computing research in my early professional career. I started working as a graduate software researcher in 2014 in the area of Software Quality Engineering at the Software Engineering Research Center, IIIT Hyderabad, under the guidance of Prof. Y. Raghu Reddy. I managed to coin a software quality metric called Defect Dependency Degree. I developed a rough-set theory-based approach to calculate a dependency of a defect over the rest of the defects in a Large Scale Integrated Software Product. I published my dissertation as part of my Master of Science by Research in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, I studied different emerging technologies. I started exploring the Virtual Reality technology domain as part of my Doctoral Research program at IIIT Hyderabad. I am working on Requirement Engineering problems for Virtual Reality and hope to graduate with a Ph.D. by 2024!"
